<h1>How Cookie Protection Works</h1>

<section class="box">
  <h2>What this extension does</h2>
  <p>
    This extension automatically removes unnecessary cookies that don’t contribute
    to your browsing experience, privacy, or security.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some cookies are required temporarily for websites to function correctly.
    These are handled safely and removed when appropriate.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="box">
  <h2>Clean Now vs Smart Protection</h2>
  <p><strong>Clean Now</strong><br>
    A manual cleanup that removes unnecessary cookies at the moment you click.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Smart Protection</strong><br>
    Automatic background protection that continuously removes unnecessary cookies
    without interrupting your browsing.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="box">
  <h2>Why some cookies may remain</h2>
  <p>
    Some cookies must remain temporarily to keep you logged in,
    prevent site breakage, and ensure security and stability.
  </p>
  <p>
    These cookies are not ignored — they are removed automatically
    once they are no longer needed.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="box">
  <h2>About “Legitimate Interest”</h2>
  <p>
    Some vendors operate under legitimate interest rather than consent.
    These are often related to analytics, security, or basic advertising infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The extension prioritizes browser stability first and removes unnecessary
    cookies under legitimate interest when it is safe to do so.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="box">
  <h2>Logged out of a site?</h2>
  <p>
    If you were logged out, it means essential session cookies were removed.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is expected behavior for strict privacy cleanup.
    Whitelist controls will be available in a future update.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="box">
  <h2>Status indicators</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Active</strong> means protection is running normally.<br>
    <strong>Inactive</strong> means an error occurred and protection is temporarily paused.
